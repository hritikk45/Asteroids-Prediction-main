    <h3>About Our Website</h3><br><br>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Here you can basically study, analyze and visualize the impacts of various types/classes of asteroids which have a
      decent probability to hit our planet. We have considered the Cumulative Impact Probability, the asteroid velocity,
      the Palermo Scale readings, the Perihelion distance and various other factors in order to predict whether the
      asteroid will hit our planet and if it does, how much of an impact it would do to our planet. </p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">If you want to see what type of class/category the asteroid comes in, you can go to the Asteroid Classification
      section and give in the necessary details regarding that asteroid and submit it which will then give you your
      output.</p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">You can also check out the possible impact a particular asteroid can have by going to the Possible Impact
      Prediction section and giving in the necessary details. If you want to Cluster/group your asteroid then you can go
      to the Clustering section and give in the details like Asteroid velocity, magnitude, etc. </p>
    <p style="font-size: large;">Also if you are interested in checking out the Visualizations of the asteroids related to various factors like
      Perihilion Distance, Asteroid velocity, magnitude, probability of impact, etc, you can head over to the
      Visualizations section and it also has a short description under each visualization so that you guys can understand
      it perfectly.</p>
